          <h1>Gojo Satoru</h1>
<p>Satoru Gojo (Japanese: 五条 悟, Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a similar Curse, helping him become stronger while protecting other characters in the series.</p>
<strong>Gojo was designed by Gege Akutami to be a formidable yet endearing figure who is passionate about his students. He is voiced by Yūichi Nakamura in Japanese and Kaiji Tang in English in the animated adaptations by MAPPA.</strong></p>
<bond>The character was well received by the media for his carefree nature and power shown when protecting his students, becoming the series’s breakout character. Furthermore, his role in the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was appreciated by the media due to his hidden depths such as his relationship with the antagonist Suguru Geto.</bond><br>
