          <h1>Yuta</h1>
<p>Yuta Okkotsu (乙おっ骨こつ憂ゆう太た Okkotsu Yūta?) is a major supporting character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series and the main protagonist of its prequel series, Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High. He was initially a special grade cursed human haunted by his late childhood friend, Rika Orimoto. Satoru Gojo mentored Yuta and enrolled him at Tokyo Jujutsu High.</p>
<strong>Yuta is currently a second-year student at Jujutsu High where he works as a jujutsu sorcerer. He was training overseas in Africa with Miguel until after the Shibuya Incident when he returned to Tokyo.</strong></p>
<bond>Yuta is a young man with disheveled black hair and dark blue eyes. As a first-year, Yuta's body language made it obvious that he was under a lot of stress. His posture was very unconfident, and he still has dark circles under his eyelids from a lack of sleep. As a second-year student, Yuta's hair has grown longer and he wears it in a more relaxed style instead of a spiky one.</bond><br>
