          <h1>Maki Zenin</h1>
<p>Maki Zenin (禪ぜん院いん真ま希き Zen'in Maki?) is a major supporting character in Jujutsu Kaisen and one of the main protagonists of its prequel, Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High. She is currently a second-year at Tokyo Jujutsu High. Daughter of Ogi Zenin and the elder twin sister of Mai Zenin, Maki was born in the Zenin Clan.</p>
<strong>Born a non-sorcerer in one of the Big Three Sorcerer Families, Maki was constantly mistreated and felt compelled to expel herself from the Zenin clan. She aspires to be a great jujutsu sorcerer to spite her family, working closely with her friends Panda and Toge Inumaki, while also serving as a role model to the first-year students.</strong></p>
<bond>Maki is a young woman with a tall athletic build. She has small golden eyes and long black hair (dark green in the anime) normally tied into a short ponytail. She had fringes of hair over her forehead with smaller strands framing her cheeks and used to sport different pairs of glasses that allowed her to see curses.</bond><br>
