          <h1>Nobara Kugisaki</h1>
<p>Nobara Kugisaki (釘くぎ崎さき野の薔ば薇ら Kugisaki Nobara?) is the tritagonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. She is a first-year student and grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer at Tokyo Jujutsu High studying under Satoru Gojo alongside Yuji and Megumi.</p>
<strong>Nobara is of average height with a slim figure. She has mid-length brown hair that reaches to her neck that is styled with bangs that cover the right side of her forehead. Nobara has orange eyes, long eyelashes and thin eyebrows of the same color.

  Nobara's jujutsu school uniform consists of a dark blue gakuran-style top (a button-down jacket) and a long matching skirt that reaches to just above her knees. She also sports black stockings and brown shoes along with her signature brown belt that holds her tools for jujutsu.</strong></p>
<bond>As someone who enjoys dressing up, Nobara has several different outfits. She didn't have a tracksuit prior to enrolling at Jujutsu High and bought one shortly after. The tracksuit included a white and blue hoodie accented with a flower pattern, black leggings, and white shoes.</bond><br>
