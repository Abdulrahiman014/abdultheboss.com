          <h1>Shoko ieiri</h1>
<p>Shoko Ieiri (家いえ入いり硝しょう子こ Ieiri Shōko?) is a character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. She is an alumna of Tokyo Jujutsu High, having been classmates with Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto. After graduating into a full-fledged jujutsu sorcerer, Shoko became the school's primary doctor.</p>
<strong>Shoko is a tall woman with long brown hair that extends past her shoulders that she sometimes ties into a ponytail when working. She has soft brown eyes with dark lines under them, making it appear as if she's underslept. Shoko has a mole underneath her right eye and thick brown eyebrows.

  Shoko normally sports a white lab coat over a blue turtle-neck swear and darker navy blue pants that reach just above her ankle. She finishes her outfit with cream-colored high-heeled shoes.</strong></p>
<bond>As a student, Shoko had short hair that only reached just past her chin with bangs swept to the left side. She wore the typical jacket-type jujutsu high uniform. For casual wear during the summer, she wore a long-sleeved shirt, shorts, and sandals.[4]</bond><br>
