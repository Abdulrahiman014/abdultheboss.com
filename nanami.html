          <h1>Nanami Kento</h1>
<p>Kento Nanami (七なな海み建けん人と Nanami Kento?) is a major supporting character in Jujutsu Kaisen. He was a former student of Tokyo Jujutsu High where he was an underclassman of Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto. Nanami initially left Jujutsu High after graduating to become a salaryman, but returned four years later to continue working as a jujutsu sorcerer.</p>
<strong>While working as a Jujutsu High sorcerer, Nanami was ranked grade 1 and operated primarily out of the Tokyo campus. With Satoru's introduction, he also became a close mentor to Yuji Itadori.</strong></p>
<bond>Nanami is a tall, well-built man with blonde hair styled with a neat part. Nanami has very thin eyebrows as well as small eyes that are usually covered by his signature sunglasses, which don't have arms that wrap around the ears.</bond><br>
