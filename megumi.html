          <h1>Megumi Fushigouro</h1>
<p>Megumi Fushiguro (伏ふし黒ぐろ恵めぐみ Fushiguro Megumi?) is the deuteragonist of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a grade 2 jujutsu sorcerer and first-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High alongside Yuji Itadori and Nobara Kugisaki. Megumi is the step-brother of Tsumiki Fushiguro and as the son of Toji Fushiguro, Megumi is also a descendant of the Zenin Clan. Megumi was born outside the clan as Toji's trump card and was eventually found by Satoru Gojo, who mentored him and enrolled him at Jujutsu High as his student.</p>
<strong>Megumi is a relatively tall, slim young man with fair skin and green eyes (dark blue in the anime adaptation). He has uniquely styled black hair with long spikes that jut out in every direction around his head, resembling a sea-urchin (according to Hakari).

  Megumi typically wears a standard Jujutsu High uniform with a dark blue jacket over a long-sleeved white dress shirt. His uniform pants match his jacket and only reach to just above his shins. He wears long black socks that cover his exposed ankles and finishes his outfit with low-top brown shoes. He also has a blue tracksuit for training.</strong></p>
<bond>In middle school, Megumi wore the Saitama Urami East Junior High uniform, which consisted of a tan jacket over a white dress shirt with black pants and white sneakers. While sneaking inside the Gachinko Fight Club, Megumi wore a black hoodie and matching pants with his normal shoes as a disguise.</bond><br>
