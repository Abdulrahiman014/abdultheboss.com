          <h1>Todo Aoi</h1>
<p>Aoi Todo (東とう堂どう葵あおい Tōdō Aoi?) is a supporting character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a third-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High School and a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer. He was mentored by Yuki Tsukumo in his youth and considers Yuji Itadori his best friend.</p>
<strong>Aoi Todo is a tall young man who stands about the same height as Satoru Gojo[3]. He has a very defined, heavy muscular build and relatively tan skin. He has small black eyes and shoulder-length black hair that is almost always tied into a top-knot bun with unusual flyaway strands with rounded ends akin to multiple stamens of a flower, befitting the meaning of his name. One of his most notable features is the large scar running down the left side of Todo's face that he got from harsh training with Yuki.

  While Todo sports his jujutsu high uniform, he usually takes his jacket off and rips the undershirt before or during the battle. He usually dons martial arts pants and slippers. Todo's choice of pants is very loose and stops above the ankle with a bright blue sash wrapped around the waist. He wore a tennis-type of outfit while playing ping-pong with Mei Mei, sporting a collared shirt and shorts rather than his normal outfit.</strong></p>
<bond>In his fantasy of attending junior high with Yuji Itadori and Takada, Todo wears a school uniform that consists of a black jacket similar to his Jujutsu High one. Like with all his jackets, Todo left it open to reveal the undershirt. Even in these forged memories, Aoi wears his blue sash with his pants.

  During the Shibuya Incident, Todo had to sever his left hand to avoid being fully transfigured by Mahito, and severely damaged his right palm by slapping Mahito's hand briefly to swap with Yuji.</bond><br>
