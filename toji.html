          <h1>Toji Fushiguro</h1>
<p>Toji Fushiguro (伏ふし黒ぐろ甚とう爾じ Fushiguro Tōji?), born Toji Zenin (禪ぜん院いん甚とう爾じ Zen'in Tōji?) is a recurring character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He was a former member of the Zenin clan and the infamous assassin known as the Sorcerer Killer (術じゅつ師し殺ごろし Jutsushi Goroshi?), contracted by the Time Vessel Association among other groups throughout his time as a non-curse user. He was also the father of Megumi Fushiguro and former enemy of Satoru Gojo. While working for the Star Religious Group, Toji serves as the primary antagonist of the Gojo's Past Arc.</p>
<strong>Toji is a tall, muscular man with mid-length straight black hair that reaches to his ears. His eyes are green, just like his son's, and he has thin black eyebrows and a scar on the corner of his right lip.</strong></p>
<bond>For casual attire, Toji wears a simple outfit consisting of a long-sleeved shirt and matching pants with sandals. While fighting, Toji wears a tight-fitting short sleeve shirt, sports tan baggy training pants with a black belt weaved through the waist and black martial arts slippers. While still a member of the Zenin clan, Toji wore a dark colored haori over a black yukata.</bond><br>
