          <h1>Geto Suguru</h1>
<p>Suguru Geto (夏げ油とう傑すぐる Getō Suguru?) is an antagonist in both the Jujutsu Kaisen series and its prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High. He was originally a student of Masamichi Yaga's alongside Satoru Gojo and Shoko Ieiri at Tokyo Jujutsu High. His experiences as a jujutsu sorcerer bred a deep hatred for non-sorcerers, leading to an incident where Suguru massacred over a hundred civilians in a single night. He was expelled from Jujutsu High and came to be known as the worst of all curse users.</p>
<strong>Suguru is a tall, slim, and muscular man with long black hair partially tied up in a man bun while the rest drapes down his back. He has thin black eyes and bangs that occasionally cover the left eye. His earlobes are large enough to fit fairly large circular earrings. In 2006, Suguru's hair was much shorter as a student, most of it tied up but his bangs were still as prominent. After August 2007 when Suguru became a curse user, his hair began to grow longer and reflect the length it is in 2017.</strong></p>
<bond>As a student, Suguru wore a normal jujutsu high uniform. While masquerading himself under the facade of a Buddhist priest, Suguru dons the appropriate attire. He sports a gold-colored kāṣāya garment over black yukata robes. His monk attire is completed with white tabi socks and zōri sandals.</bond><br>
